## How the Web Works

The web works through a client-server model where a web browser (client) sends a request for a webpage to a web server, which then sends back the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the browser to assemble and display the page. This process involves using the Domain Name System (DNS) to translate a domain name into an IP address, sending the request via HTTP, and the server responding with the requested resources. The browser then renders the code into the visual webpage you see.
